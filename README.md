## Twitter Pocket

Twitter Pocket is a java-made application, allowing a user to tweet, comment, an like tweets.
It's a very simple project with the mains features of original the Twitter/X (except for the rt feature).


### **Functionalities:**

-Create a new tweet, and choose a username to post it on the main page.

-Like and comment tweets.


### **How to get:**
Beforehand, ensure you have the following installed:
Java/JDK 21 or later.

Clone the repos using this line:
git clone https://github.com/ton-repo/twitter-pocket.git
And open it into a supported IDE (ex: IntelliJ)
Then compile and execute it.

### **How to use:**

Run the application, and use the "New Tweet" button to write a new tweet.
Once you get on the "new tweet" window, you can choose the username you want to tweet with, and type a
message. "Send tweet", sends the tweet into the main page.

You can now like the tweet, and add a comment (unfortunately, you can't choose a username for your comment. Your comments will always be "Anonymous" )

~~The rt button is also here, but it doesn't work (I was lacking time)~~


### **Technologies:**

-Java 

-Swing & awt for graphical interface.
